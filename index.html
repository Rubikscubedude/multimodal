  <h1>Name Here -  Is Piracy Justified?</h1>
  <p>In the digital age, the world has become increasingly lawless. 
    Companies try to push their rights, and people resort to piracy. 
    In this blog, we will explore the various reasons many people cite for and against piracy. 
  </p>

  <div name="menu-item-1"> 
  <h2>What is digital piracy?</h2>
  <aside><img id="pirate_pic" src="sea_pirates.jpg"></aside>
  <p>Piracy, as defined by this study is:
      <blockquote>Digital piracy refers to the unauthorized access or
      dissemination of licensed digital content and products.</blockquote> 
      While piracy <em>is</em> often associated with what ancient pirate skullywags did 
      (it's almost in the name), it is fundamentally different. <br>
      Pirates, back in the day, used intimidation and physical force, and invasion of personal property to gain booty they otherwise couldn't have legally. Since physical goods <small>(such as gold)</small> are limited resources (energy cannot be created or destroyed), this means that you hurt another person by <b>taking something they once owned away from them.</b>
      
    </p>
    <p>Digital piracy, on the other hand, is a bit different, and there are generally two different camps, although they both share one commonality: <b>you don't take away a physical good.</b><br>One camp of piracy is akin to plagiarism (taking something and claiming it's yours). In this circumstance, the pirate makes profit through other actions such as plaigarism. Here, the act of piracy technically doesn't <b>take away</b> anything from the original author; the act of plaigarism is what takes away profits and recognition. Howeevr, piracy with this intention in mind certainly hurts the publishers and the author.<br>On the other hand, we have all other piracy for personal reasons. The pirate does <b>not</b> make any money from pirating content, and as a result, the original author of the content doesn't experience any direct losses. However, they may experience <b>indirect losses</b> that could come from the monetary licensing of the digital product.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="piracy_bad">
    <h2>Why should we stop piracy, how does it harm people?</h2>
    <p>As mentioned before, piracy can limit a publisher's - and by proxy, authors - income, especially if it is used by others to make profit off of their stolen product, or on a large scale of rrefusal to buy. While never the sole reason for a company's bankruptcy, it certainly does make every mitsake a closer threat to the unfortunate end.</p>
    <br><p> Another reason is the tarnishing of a brand's reputation. If news goes out about a commpany's products or documents being leaked (such as activation keys, passwords, emails, etc), then that company's reputation as a trustworthy company goes down. For example, this year alone 4chan suffered a massive server breach by hackers exploiting outdated software, which led them to not only leak the entire source code of the website, but also the emails and IPs of the moderators and other people on the website. While some may rejoice at the thought of soyjaks having their data leaked, this severe hack has forever tarnished 4chan's reputation of being a <b>secure</b> place for many different types of people to share ideas and communicate to each other. If a company counldn't keep their data, or even their product IP safe, how could you trust that they won't do it again? While skilled cybersecurity experts have resolved the vulnerabilities in 4chan (for real, not an illusion this time), they still couldn't fix the reputation loss, and because of this leak, people might simply choose not to engage with them. This is only a textbook example of many data breaches that occur, and being even remotely thought of as 'a breached service' makes HR tremble in anticipation of damage control. Piracy, when it is made possible through hacks and data brreaches, can make users and businesses alike worry about their leaked information. and ruin a business' reputation of being trustworthy of doing business with. </p> 
  <div id="piracy_good">
  <h2>Why Piracy may not be as bad as it may seem</h2>
  <p>While Piracy does have its severe downsides, it still can do good for people. When used correctly, it can actually make a positive difference in the world.</p>
  <h3>1. Preservation of Media and Culture</h3>
  <p>If a company is no longer selling/updating/supporting a media, or is bankrupt or out of business (video game for example), customers who would be willing to purchase a copy of the product are physically unable to. It is totally unreasonable to expect a company to provide support for every single product they have ever made for ever. Piracy can breathe new life into a product or media that has otherwise been killed by the author. Decentralized peer-to-peer networks, while not always the best source for software or media, are certainly the most reliable. This is due to the fact that it's easier to take out a small list of known servers than fighting whack-a-mole with peers that can easily come and go. And, there will always be that one neckbeard wizard making sure that the one software they are passionate about can never truly die off.
    <br> Furthermore, piracy allows for archiving of possibly highly influential pieces that have shaped the way we think. Forever blocking it off to only people who have paid for it during a specific time is unfair to those who were unable who were not able to experience it. Like mentioned before, there are always people willing to keep something alive, so having some companies offload support of end-of-life and old software to the public by open-sourcing essentially means the company 'hires' a person for free. And, when the developer does a great enough job (for example, by patching critical bugs and implementing community features), it can make the public wonder, <q>If this is what I can get from them for free, imagine how much better their paid content is.</q>
</p><h3>2. Piracy provides a better experience for the consumer</h3>
<p>  It is a tautology that getting something is better when you can get it for free. And, with companies investing in stronger anti-piracy measures, this only worsens the problem. Modern games use kernel-level anticheat, DRM, and other restrictions. While these are intended to stop pirates, this inevitably hurts paid customers by adding more friction. Often times, pirated content can be modified to get around these restrictions, essentially playing a cat-mouse game, along with being generally easier to transfer from device to device. Seeing this, even some paid customers may consider piracy for their next content. 

</p><h3>3. Piracy as an investment in future customers </h3>
  <p> In many countries, there are people who wish they could listen to certain artists, yet are sanctioned by tarrifs, firewalls, or simple poverty. Piracy, while it might not result in immediate profits, certainly is a great investment for future customers that many artists can use to gain a following. For example, Justin Beiber started off his music career by posting free content on YouTube, and when a publisher (and many fans around the world) noticed his talent, he was able to quickly rise to fame as a talented musician.</p>
  <p> In addition to building careers, piracy, and free online distribution can also help <i>maintain and grow</i>. The classic example of this is the band Radiohead. For their album <i>In Rainbows</i>, they let people pay the price they wanted for their music, whether it was $0, $10, or something in between. While obviously some people never paid, there were some donors who definitely showed they loved the music through donations, whether at the initial download or again after enjoying the music. This shows that forcing payment <b>doesn't always have to be the solution.</b> Radiohead embraced pirates and freedom and in turn, they were able to be successful and heard.</p>

    <h2>Solutions</h2>
      <p>What could modern companies do to minimize the damage caused by piracy?</p>
      <p>Currently, they are employing various restrictions and practices designed to hurt piracy:</p>
      <dl>
      <dt>Digital Rights Management (<a href="https://consumerrights.wiki/Digital_rights_management">DRM</a>)</dt>
      <dd>DRM is when software, or any other digital product, has certain features that make it harder for the purchaser to share. While it does make it harder for pirates, it mostly hurts paying customers, who are now inconvenienced by this software. The pirates know they can go to another source to get a better experience, without being shackled by DRM. <br> While not explicitly DRM, here is a case of Netflix locking down <b>where and how</b> you can watch on your subscription.
      <iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/o4GZUCwVRLs?si=HdI7gD6hPhasx8Ef" title="Piracy is COMPLETELY justified: Louis tries NetFlix & remembers why" width="1280" height="720"></iframe></dd>
      <br><dt>Rate Limiting / Paywalling / Price Hike</dt>
      <dd>Companies use various tactics to walk back on their services. By limiting what they can offer, they can better secure their copyright, however the public may not respond well to losing their services. <br> An example is YouTube trying to block adblockers on their website, which hurts the revenue they make (their business model relies on users seeing advertisements). This, obviously, is not taken well by people who notice the amount of ads being shoved in front of their face, and they turn to alternatives. 
      <iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/_GARcKCaUfI?si=puXkJCX7XiaORBmo" title="YouTube's adblock war is backfiring in the worst way possible 🤣 " width="1280" height="720"></iframe></dd>
      <br><dt>Know Your Customer (KYC) / fingerprinting</dt>
      <dd>This is where companies look at user behavior, and target suspicious users. An example of this is Netflix tracking your IP address when you sign in. If they see a login from a suspicious IP, they may block it, possibly preventing you from sharing a password with a friend.</dd>
    </dl>

  <div id="menu-item-5">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, there are many reasons ways that piracy affects various people. 
        While it still does prevent creators and studios from making maximum profit, it could still be used as a tool to gain popularity with those currently unable to support the project. And, the more companies fight back against piracy, the stronger its appeal becomes.</p>
    <p>As long as the internet exists, piracy is here to stay. However, that does not mean that there are no solutions to this. 
    <br>Instead of companies fighting back through DRM and other restrictions, companies could work to make their services more streamlined, making it simpler to enjoy the content on their platforms than a simple download. 
    Instead of being stingy with every single penny they could possibly make for their shareholders, it would be beneficial if they focused on keeping honest business ethics and delivering more than expected to the customer. And, for consumers: We should vote with our money and time <small>(and the lack thereof)</small> to show companies what we truly value.

    <h2>Project Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Looking back on the project, it was interesting to look at what various people have to say about piracy. It is certainly a complex and murky topic, and I hope I did justice to how important it is to some. 
      To be quite honest, being on the internet feels bad, whether it is putting through what companies try to do to take away people's rights, or the moral dullness of pirating online content. I personally felt there needed to be a change, and through this I was better able to articulate it.
